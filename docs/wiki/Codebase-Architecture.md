## The Three-Layer Convention

| Directory | Owner | Rule |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Base directories (e.g., `Content.Server/Station/`) | Upstream SS14 | Do not modify unless absolutely necessary |
| `_Stalker/` | Upstream Stalker-14 (closed Russian fork) | Do not modify unless absolutely necessary |
| `_Stalker_EN/` | **This fork** | **All new code goes here** |

### Why This Exists

Stalker-14-EN sits at the end of a three-project inheritance chain:

```
Space Station 14 (upstream engine + content)
  +-- Stalker-14 (closed Russian fork)
       +-- stalker-14-EN (English localization + new features)
```

Upstream Stalker-14 changes get merged periodically. The `_Stalker_EN/` convention creates a clean boundary: upstream merges only touch base and `_Stalker/` files, while EN work only touches `_Stalker_EN/` files. Conflicts become rare and isolated.

> **Warning**: When you *must* modify a file outside `_Stalker_EN/`, mark changes with `// stalker-en` (single line) or `// stalker-en-start` / `// stalker-en-end` (multi-line blocks). Do **not** use `// stalker-changes`, which is the upstream Stalker marker.

## Directory Structure

## Client / Server / Shared Split

**Shared** (`Content.Shared/`): Compiled into both client and server. Components, events, shared systems (prediction), data types, enums.

**Server** (`Content.Server/`): Server-only. Authoritative game logic, anti-cheat, database access, hidden AI decisions.

**Client** (`Content.Client/`): Client-only. UI (always XAML), visual effects, input handling, prediction overrides.

### How to Decide

1. **Both sides need this type or logic?** Shared.
2. **Determines what "really happened"?** Server.
3. **Purely visual, UI, or input?** Client.
4. **Unsure?** Default to Server.

> **Tip**: Components almost always go in Shared, even if the system is server-only. The client needs the component definition to deserialize entity state.

## CCVars: Runtime Configuration

CCVars can be changed at runtime through the server console or config files without recompiling.

EN-specific CCVars are defined in `Content.Shared/_Stalker_EN/CCVar/` as partial classes on `STCCVars`:

| File | Feature Area |
|------|-------------|
| `STCCVars.Emission.cs` | Emission system visuals and raycasting |
| `STCCVars.FactionRelations.cs` | Discord webhook, cooldown, proposal expiration |
| `STCCVars.LateJoin.cs` | Late join announcement toggle |
| `STCCVars.Loadout.cs` | Rate limiting |
| `STCCVars.Messenger.cs` | Discord webhook, max message length |

All EN CVars use the `stalkeren.*` prefix. Upstream Stalker uses `stalker.*`. Do not add new variables to `_Stalker/CCCCVars/`; use the `STCCVars` partial class in `_Stalker_EN/`.

To add a new CCVar: create `STCCVars.YourFeature.cs` in `Content.Shared/_Stalker_EN/CCVar/`. Naming: `stalkeren.feature.variable_name`. Flags: `CVar.SERVERONLY`, `CVar.CLIENTONLY`, `CVar.REPLICATED`, `CVar.CONFIDENTIAL`.
